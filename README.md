### About Me

I'm a Computer Science undergrad passionate about mixing technology, design, and psychology to build things that matter. Whether it's **gamified learning**, **AI-generated children's songs**, or tools to support kids with ADHD, I believe tech can (and should!) be inclusive, fun, and empowering.

- Currently working on **Mnemoro**: a gamified app that teaches memory techniques to children with ADHD
- Exploring **mnemonics** to improve memory.
- Always learning: from machine learning to entrepreneurship.
